## 1. Project Overview

### What We're Building

An AI-powered clinical audit system that automatically evaluates whether GP (general practitioner) consultations for **musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions** adhere to **NICE clinical guidelines**.

### The Problem

In the UK, MSK conditions (back pain, osteoarthritis, fractures, etc.) account for ~15% of all GP appointments (~14 million visits/year). NICE publishes evidence-based guidelines on how these conditions should be managed — what to prescribe, when to refer to a specialist, what imaging to order, etc.

Currently, checking whether doctors follow these guidelines requires **manual chart review** by trained clinicians. This is:
- Extremely slow (the CrossCover trial could only audit 120 out of 10,000+ cases manually)
- Expensive (requires expert clinician time)
- Inconsistent (different auditors may judge differently)
- Impossible to scale

### The Solution

A 4-agent AI pipeline that processes patient records and scores them against clinical guidelines:

```
Patient Record → [Extractor] → [Query Generator] → [Retriever] → [Scorer] → Audit Report
```

1. **Extractor Agent** — Reads structured patient data (SNOMED-coded clinical entries), categorises each entry as a diagnosis, treatment, procedure, referral, etc.
2. **Query Agent** — Takes extracted clinical concepts and generates targeted search queries for finding relevant guidelines.
3. **Retriever Agent** — Uses semantic search (PubMedBERT embeddings + FAISS vector index) to find the most relevant NICE guideline passages for each query.
4. **Scorer Agent** — Compares documented clinical decisions against retrieved guidelines using an LLM, producing per-diagnosis adherence scores (+1 adherent / -1 non-adherent) with explanations of guidelines followed/not followed, and a final aggregate score (proportion of adherent diagnoses).

### The Data

- **Input:** ~4,327 anonymised MSK patients (21,530 clinical event rows) from the CrossCover clinical trial, coded in SNOMED CT
- **Knowledge Base:** 1,656 NICE guideline documents, embedded as vectors in a FAISS index
- **Validation:** 120 cases manually audited by expert clinicians (gold standard for measuring system accuracy)

### End Goal

A system that can:
- Process the full patient dataset and produce audit scores for every patient
- Be validated against the 120 gold-standard human audits
- Generate aggregate reports showing guideline adherence patterns across the dataset
- Be extended to other clinical domains beyond MSK

### Origin

This project builds upon the **GuidelineGuard** framework (Shahriyear, 2024) and two MSc dissertations from Keele University:
- **Hiruni Vidanapathirana** — built the Extractor + Query agents
- **Cyprian Toroitich** — built the Retriever + Scorer agents

We are **not copying** their work. We are analysing it, taking what's good, fixing what's bad, and rebuilding the entire system as a unified, production-grade pipeline.

## 2. Reference Codebases Analysis

### 2A. GuidelineGuard Paper (Shahriyear, 2024)

**What it is:** The foundational IEEE paper that defines the 4-agent architecture.

**What it did well:**
- Clean conceptual architecture — the 4-agent split is logical and well-motivated
- Used Llama-3 70B (strong open-source model)
- Tested across 8 medical specialties with scored results
- Clear scoring rubric (+1/-1 per diagnosis)
- Good use of RAG to ground LLM judgments in real guidelines

**What it did poorly / limitations:**
- Only tested on synthetic/example medical notes (not real patient data)
- No validation against human auditor judgments
- Limited to 300-1000 word free-text notes — our data is structured SNOMED codes, not free text
- Scoring is binary (+1/-1) with no nuance (partial adherence not captured)
- No error handling or production considerations discussed

**What we're taking:**
- The 4-agent architecture (Extractor → Query → Retriever → Scorer)
- The RAG approach for grounding scores in real guidelines
- PubMedBERT for medical embeddings
- FAISS for vector search
- The basic scoring concept (per-diagnosis evaluation)

**What we're improving:**
- Adapting for structured SNOMED data (not free-text notes)
- Adding nuanced scoring (not just binary +1/-1)
- Validation against gold-standard human audits
- Production-grade error handling, logging, configurability
- Unified LLM with provider abstraction

### 2B. Hiruni's Implementation (Extractor + Query Agent)

**Files:** `Hiruni/extractor.py`, `Hiruni/query_agent.py`, `Hiruni/pipeline.py`, `Hiruni/snomed/`

**What she built:**
- `ExtractorAgent` class that iterates through clinical entries and categorises each via FHIR/SNOMED lookup
- `HadesFHIRClient` that queries a local FHIR server to get semantic tags (disorder, procedure, finding, etc.)
- `ClinicalNote` and `ClinicalEntry` data models
- `QueryAgent` class that uses a local Mistral-7B (via llama_cpp) to generate guideline search queries
- LangGraph pipeline wiring Extractor → Query Agent
- Data loading and cleaning utilities (`build_note`, `safe_str`)

**What she did well:**
- SNOMED CT integration via FHIR is the correct approach for standardised medical coding
- Clean data model separation (ClinicalNote/ClinicalEntry)
- Semantic tag extraction from FSN (Fully Specified Name) is clever — parses "(disorder)", "(procedure)", etc.
- Proper date handling with fallbacks

**What she did poorly:**
- Hardcoded Windows paths (`C:\Users\hirun\agentic-msk\...`) everywhere
- Requires a local FHIR server (HADES) that isn't included or documented for setup
- Mistral-7B via llama_cpp is underpowered for medical query generation
- No error handling on FHIR lookups (network failures crash the pipeline)
- No logging whatsoever
- No tests
- `build_note` mixes data transformation with I/O concerns
- The LangGraph state management is minimal — no retry, no error nodes
- Hardcoded model path
- Date parsing is fragile (assumes specific formats)

**What we're taking:**
- The concept of SNOMED semantic tag extraction for categorisation
- The ClinicalNote/ClinicalEntry data model pattern (redesigned)
- The idea of FHIR-based lookups (but we need an alternative since HADES isn't available)

**What we're replacing:**
- FHIR server dependency → rule-based regex categoriser + LLM fallback (84%/16% split, no external server)
- Mistral-7B for query generation → three-tier approach: hand-crafted templates for common MSK conditions + LLM (via provider abstraction) for rare diagnoses + default fallback. Templates produce queries optimised for PubMedBERT similarity.
- Hardcoded paths → environment variables and config
- Raw LangGraph → our own clean pipeline orchestration

### 2C. Cyprian's Implementation (Retriever + Scorer Agent)

**Files:** `Cyprian/scorer_deployed.ipynb`, `Cyprian/guidelines.csv`, `Cyprian/guidelines.index`

**What he built:**
- FAISS vector index over 1,656 NICE guideline documents
- PubMedBERT Matryoshka embeddings for encoding guidelines and queries
- Retriever Agent that searches the FAISS index and returns top-5 guideline chunks
- Scorer Agent that uses GPT-3.5-turbo to evaluate adherence per diagnosis
- Flask JSON-RPC servers for inter-agent communication (ports 5000/5001)
- LangGraph workflow wiring Retriever → Scorer
- 5 test cases with expected scores

**What he did well:**
- PubMedBERT is the right embedding model for medical domain — much better than general-purpose embeddings
- FAISS with cosine similarity is efficient and appropriate
- The scoring prompt is well-structured (diagnosis + treatments + guidelines → score + explanation)
- The JSON-RPC A2A pattern shows understanding of microservice communication
- Pre-built FAISS indices are included (ready to use)

**What he did poorly:**
- Google Colab notebook — not reproducible, not deployable
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo (weakest GPT model for complex medical reasoning)
- Flask servers running in threads — fragile, not production-ready
- Global mutable state (`scorer_state` dict) — race conditions, not thread-safe
- Hardcoded Colab paths (`/content/...`)
- API key stored via `google.colab.userdata` — not portable
- No error handling on OpenAI API calls
- No logging
- No tests (the 5 "test cases" are manual integration tests, not automated)
- Scoring prompt truncates guidelines to 500 chars — loses critical context
- Only passes treatments to the scorer prompt — ignores referrals, investigations, and procedures
- The `expected_score` for test case 2 has a syntax error (missing value)
- Regex for score parsing is case-sensitive but searches lowercase content — critical bug that causes all scores to default to -1
- JSON-RPC is over-engineered for a single-process pipeline

**What we're taking:**
- FAISS index and PubMedBERT embedding approach (proven, appropriate)
- The pre-built `guidelines.index` and `guidelines.csv` (valuable assets)
- The scoring prompt structure (diagnosis + treatment + guidelines → evaluation)
- Cosine similarity for retrieval

**What we're replacing:**
- Colab notebook → proper Python modules
- GPT-3.5-turbo → GPT-4o-mini or better (via abstraction layer)
- Flask JSON-RPC → direct function calls within a unified pipeline
- Global mutable state → proper state management (singleton Embedder + VectorStore with load/unload)
- Truncated guidelines (500 chars, 1 guideline) → intelligent formatting with up to 2,000 chars and all top-K guidelines
- Only treatments in scorer → full clinical context (treatments + referrals + investigations + procedures)
- Case-sensitive regex bug → case-insensitive parsing with robust edge case handling
- Manual test cases → automated test suite (32 scorer tests)
- Naive "guidelines for concept_name" queries → expert-crafted templates + LLM queries from Query Agent
- No deduplication → merge + dedup results across multiple queries per diagnosis
- `faiss.normalize_L2` on non-writable tensors → numpy normalization (fixed segfault bug)

### Technology Choices

| Component | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Language** | Python 3.11+ | All reference code is Python; strongest AI/ML ecosystem |
| **Web Framework** | FastAPI | Async support, auto-generated OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation, type-safe. Flask (used by Cyprian) is too minimal. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Production-grade, stores audit results/patient data/job tracking. SQLite is not suitable for concurrent access. |
| **ORM** | SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic | Industry standard, async support, migration management |
| **Vector Search** | FAISS | Already proven in reference code, fast, no external service needed at this scale |
| **Embeddings** | PubMedBERT Matryoshka | Domain-specific medical embeddings, proven effective in Cyprian's work |
| **LLM (default)** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Good balance of cost/quality for medical reasoning. Abstraction layer allows swapping. |
| **LLM Abstraction** | Custom provider pattern | Strategy pattern — swap providers via env var, zero code changes |
| **Pipeline Orchestration** | Custom pipeline (not LangGraph) | LangGraph adds complexity without proportional benefit for a linear 4-step pipeline. Simple, testable functions are better. |
| **Medical Coding** | Rule-based regex + LLM fallback | Two-tier SNOMED categoriser: regex patterns handle 84% of concepts, LLM classifies the remaining 16%. No FHIR server needed. |
| **Query Generation** | Templates + LLM + defaults | Three-tier: hand-crafted templates for ~15 common MSK conditions, LLM for rare diagnoses, generic defaults as fallback. Templates optimised for PubMedBERT similarity. |
| **Guideline Scoring** | LLM with structured prompt | Per-diagnosis scoring via LLM (temperature=0), includes full clinical context + up to 2,000 chars of guideline text. Case-insensitive regex parsing of structured output. |
| **Configuration** | Pydantic Settings | Type-safe, validates on startup, reads from .env files |
| **Logging** | Python `logging` + `structlog` | Structured JSON logs, correlation IDs, proper levels |
| **Containerisation** | Docker + Docker Compose | Reproducible environments, one-command setup |
| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-asyncio + aiosqlite | Standard Python testing, async support, in-memory SQLite for query tests |
| **Task Runner** | Makefile | Simple, universal, documents common commands |

### Why NOT LangGraph?

The reference implementations use LangGraph for pipeline orchestration. We're **not** using it because:
1. Our pipeline is **linear** (A → B → C → D) — LangGraph's graph capabilities are overkill
2. LangGraph adds a **heavy dependency** with its own state management conventions
3. Simple function composition is **easier to test**, debug, and understand
4. LangGraph's state typing is awkward for complex nested data
5. We lose nothing by using plain Python — and gain simplicity and full control

Instead, we'll build a `Pipeline` class that chains agent functions together with proper error handling, logging, and state passing.

## 6. Decisions Log

### Decision 001: FastAPI over Flask (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need a web framework for the API layer.
**Choice:** FastAPI
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Flask — too minimal, no built-in validation, no async, no auto-docs. Cyprian used Flask and the result was fragile threaded servers.
- Django — too heavy for an API-only service, brings ORM we don't need (using SQLAlchemy).
**Reasoning:** FastAPI gives us Pydantic validation, automatic OpenAPI docs, async support, and type safety out of the box.

### Decision 002: PostgreSQL over SQLite (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need a database for storing patient data, audit results, job tracking.
**Choice:** PostgreSQL
**Alternatives rejected:**
- SQLite — no concurrent access, no production deployment, file-based.
- MongoDB — our data is relational (patients → entries → audits), not document-oriented.
**Reasoning:** PostgreSQL is the industry standard for relational data, handles concurrency, works in Docker, and scales.

### Decision 003: Custom pipeline over LangGraph (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need to orchestrate 4 agents in sequence.
**Choice:** Custom Pipeline class with plain Python function composition.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- LangGraph — adds heavy dependency, complex state management, overkill for a linear pipeline. Both reference implementations used it but gained little from it.
- Celery — too heavy for this; we're not distributing across workers yet.
**Reasoning:** A linear pipeline of 4 functions doesn't need a graph framework. Simple is better. We retain full control, testability, and debuggability.

### Decision 004: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini as default LLM (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need an LLM for query generation and scoring.
**Choice:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (default), with provider abstraction for swapping.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Mistral-7B local (Hiruni's choice) — underpowered for medical reasoning, requires local GPU/CPU resources.
- GPT-3.5-turbo (Cyprian's choice) — cheapest but weakest at complex medical evaluation.
- GPT-4o — more capable but significantly more expensive; 4o-mini offers 90% of the quality at 10% of the cost.
**Reasoning:** GPT-4o-mini balances cost and quality. The abstraction layer means we can switch to any provider (Claude, Gemini, local models) by changing one env var.

### Decision 005: SNOMED lookup without FHIR server (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Hiruni's implementation required a local HADES FHIR server for SNOMED lookups. This server is not included and is complex to set up.
**Choice:** Two-tier SNOMED categoriser: rule-based regex patterns (84% coverage) + LLM fallback (16%).
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Requiring HADES FHIR server — creates a heavy external dependency, not included in project files, complex to configure.
- NHS SNOMED CT API — requires registration, rate limits, external dependency.
- Pure LLM classification — unnecessary cost when most concepts have obvious keywords.
**Reasoning:** The dataset has 1,261 unique concepts with human-readable display names. Regex patterns matching medical keywords and suffixes (-itis, -ectomy, -pathy, -osis) classify 1,069 concepts instantly and for free. The remaining 192 edge cases use the LLM. Each concept is classified once and cached. **Implemented:** `src/services/snomed_categoriser.py`.

### Decision 006: Template-first query generation over pure LLM (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Need to generate search queries from diagnoses for FAISS guideline retrieval.
**Choice:** Three-tier approach: hand-crafted templates for common MSK diagnoses, LLM for rare diagnoses, default generic queries as fallback.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Pure LLM generation (Hiruni's approach) — every diagnosis goes through LLM, even "Low back pain" where we know exactly what queries work best. Slower, costs money, and LLM doesn't know how our FAISS index is structured.
- Pure template generation — wouldn't handle unusual diagnoses like "Acquired hallux valgus" or "Dupuytren's contracture".
**Reasoning:** For common MSK conditions (~15 templates), we can write better queries than an LLM because we know how NICE guidelines are titled and structured. Templates are free, instant, deterministic, and can be empirically tuned against the FAISS index. For rare diagnoses, the LLM generates queries with episode context (treatments, referrals). Default queries ensure the pipeline never fails. **Implemented:** `src/agents/query.py`.

### Decision 007: Numpy L2 normalization over faiss.normalize_L2 (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Embedding vectors need L2 normalization before FAISS search (so inner product = cosine similarity). Cyprian used `faiss.normalize_L2()`.
**Choice:** Pure numpy normalization (`embedding / np.linalg.norm(embedding)`).
**Alternatives rejected:**
- `faiss.normalize_L2()` — causes segmentation fault when called on numpy arrays derived from PyTorch tensors (non-writable memory). Known compatibility issue between faiss-cpu, torch, and numpy on macOS.
**Reasoning:** Mathematically identical result. Numpy normalization creates a new array, avoiding the in-place modification that crashes. No performance difference for our use case. **Implemented:** `src/services/embedder.py`.

### Decision 008: Full clinical context in scorer prompt (2026-03-01)
**Context:** Cyprian's scorer only passed treatments to the LLM. NICE guidelines also recommend referrals (e.g., "refer to physiotherapy"), investigations (e.g., "order blood tests"), and procedures.
**Choice:** Include treatments, referrals, investigations, and procedures in the scoring prompt.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Treatments only (Cyprian's approach) — misses critical guideline adherence signals. A patient correctly referred to physiotherapy would score as non-adherent.
**Reasoning:** NICE guidelines cover all aspects of care, not just prescriptions. Including the full clinical context gives the LLM a complete picture and produces more accurate adherence scores. **Implemented:** `src/agents/scorer.py`.

### Decision 009: Conservative default scoring on parse failure (2026-03-01)
**Context:** If the LLM's response can't be parsed (garbled output, unexpected format), what score should we assign?
**Choice:** Default to -1 (non-adherent).
**Alternatives considered:**
- Default to +1 — too optimistic, could hide real non-adherence.
- Default to 0 or null — would require a third score type, complicating downstream analysis.
- Throw an error — too aggressive, would halt processing.
**Reasoning:** Defaulting to -1 is the conservative, safe choice. It ensures unparseable responses get flagged for human review rather than silently passing. Combined with the `error` field on DiagnosisScore, these cases can be easily identified and investigated.

### Decision 010: Background tasks for batch processing (2026-03-02)
**Context:** Batch auditing 4,327 patients will take hours (LLM calls for scoring). The HTTP request would time out.
**Choice:** Use FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` to run the batch in a background coroutine with its own DB session.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Celery — too heavy for a single-process deployment. No distributed workers needed.
- Synchronous batch endpoint — would time out for large batches.
- WebSocket streaming — more complex, no need for real-time updates (polling is fine).
**Reasoning:** `BackgroundTasks` is built into FastAPI, requires no external broker, and integrates with our async pipeline. The client creates a job, gets back a job ID, and polls for progress. The background task commits progress every 10 patients and handles its own error recovery. **Implemented:** `src/api/routes/audit.py`.

### Decision 011: Separate reporting route file and service layer (2026-03-02)
**Context:** Need reporting/analytics endpoints for reviewing audit results. Could add to existing `audit.py` routes or create separate files.
**Choice:** Separate `src/services/reporting.py` (computation) + `src/api/routes/reports.py` (thin route layer).
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Adding to `audit.py` — audit routes handle pipeline execution (write path); reporting is read-only analytics (read path). Mixing them would grow `audit.py` and conflate concerns.
- No service layer — putting SQL queries in route handlers. Would make functions untestable without HTTP client, harder to extend for gold-standard metrics later.
**Reasoning:** Separation of concerns: reporting service is independently testable, extensible (add `get_validation_metrics()` later), and keeps routes thin. The `_load_completed_results()` helper avoids query duplication between functions that need details_json parsing. Python-side aggregation is appropriate because ~4,327 patients is trivially small in memory and `details_json` is TEXT not JSONB.

### Decision 012: aiosqlite for reporting tests (2026-03-02)
**Context:** Reporting functions execute real SQL queries (aggregations, filters). Need to test actual query logic.
**Choice:** In-memory SQLite via `aiosqlite` for test fixtures.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Mocking `session.execute()` — fragile, requires mock objects for Result/Row types, breaks when query order changes. `get_dashboard_stats()` makes 4 separate execute calls, each needing different mock return types.
- Requiring PostgreSQL for tests — adds infrastructure dependency, slows tests, unnecessary for unit-level validation.
**Reasoning:** In-memory SQLite tests real SQL queries without external dependencies. Tables are created from the same SQLAlchemy models (via `Base.metadata.create_all`), ensuring schema stays in sync. Tests run in <1 second and are robust against implementation refactors.

**Phase 7a:** COMPLETE — Reporting Endpoints (4 analytics endpoints + service layer)

**What was done in Phase 7a:**
- Reporting service: `src/services/reporting.py` with 4 public analytics functions + 1 shared query helper
- Dashboard stats: total audited/failed, mean/median/min/max adherence score, failure rate (SQL aggregation)

- All endpoints accept optional `?job_id=N` to scope to a specific batch run
- Added `aiosqlite==0.20.0` for async in-memory SQLite testing
- 216 unit tests passing (up from 190 in Phase 6, +26 new reporting tests)
- Learning doc: `docs/learning/10-reporting-explained.md`

**The system now has both pipeline execution and reporting analytics.** Available endpoints:
```
Audit (write path):
  POST /api/v1/audit/patient/{pat_id}   — Single patient audit
  POST /api/v1/audit/batch              — Batch audit (background)
  GET  /api/v1/audit/jobs/{job_id}      — Job progress
  GET  /api/v1/audit/results/{pat_id}   — Patient results

Reports (read path):
  GET  /api/v1/reports/dashboard         — Summary stats
  GET  /api/v1/reports/conditions        — Per-condition breakdown
  GET  /api/v1/reports/non-adherent      — Non-adherent cases
  GET  /api/v1/reports/score-distribution — Score histogram
```

**Key files:**
- Reporting service: `src/services/reporting.py`
- Report API: `src/api/routes/reports.py`
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_reporting.py`

**Blockers:** None.

**Next session should start with:** Phase 7b — Gold-Standard Validation
1. Import gold-standard audit data (120 cases manually scored by clinicians)
2. Run our pipeline against those 120 patients
3. Compare AI scores vs human auditor scores
4. Generate accuracy/agreement metrics (Cohen's kappa, etc.)
5. Add `get_validation_metrics()` to reporting service + new endpoint
6. Write tests
7. Update learning docs + PROJECT_BIBLE.md

---

## 8. Known Issues / Tech Debt

- **Local PostgreSQL port conflict:** Host machine has a native PostgreSQL on port 5432, so our Docker DB uses port 5433. When running Alembic or scripts locally, must set `DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5433`.
- **torch version pinned to 2.2.2:** Python 3.11 doesn't support torch 2.5.1. Will need updating if Python is upgraded.
- **SNOMED categoriser coverage at 84%:** 192 of 1,261 concepts require LLM fallback. Coverage could be improved by adding more patterns, but diminishing returns — LLM handles the rest.
- **faiss.normalize_L2 segfault on macOS:** `faiss.normalize_L2()` crashes when called on numpy arrays from PyTorch tensors. Worked around by using numpy normalization instead. May not affect Linux/Docker.
- **Embedder tests use bert-tiny model:** Real PubMedBERT (~440MB) too large for unit tests. Tests use `prajjwal1/bert-tiny` (17MB, 128-dim) — same encoding logic, different weights. Integration tests with real model needed.
- **Scorer tests use mock LLM:** Unit tests mock the AI provider. Integration tests with a real LLM needed to validate prompt quality and parsing against actual LLM outputs.
- **Binary scoring only:** Current scoring is +1/-1 (adherent/non-adherent). No partial adherence score. The paper uses the same binary scheme, but nuanced scoring could improve accuracy.

# Start the app
DB_HOST=localhost uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
# Health check at http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Running Tests
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for all required variables with descriptions.

### Important Notes
